**Important Information**

This project is a game program developed from scratch.

**Note: Game Description**

A 1990’s Pokémon-like text-based game where the player acts as the hero and fights against enemies.
The game uses object-oriented concepts as the basis to include knights, mages and a dragon among 
the enemies. The game utilises ascii characters to display graphics in the terminal. Fine-details are 
added to the storyline to make the program interesting, including hidden buffs and power-ups.

This is an independent project, built from scratch!

**To run game, export the code files to a folder, navigate to a folder via the terminal and use command "make test"!**
