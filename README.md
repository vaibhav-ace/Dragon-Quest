This project was undertaken in an Object Oriented Programming course at The University of Adelaide.
This game program was developed by me and a partner in the course. Please do not plagiarise the code which might cause yourself legal or copyright issues.
All permissions were asked from the Partner before publishing this code to a public GitHub repository.

**Note: Game Description**

A 1990’s Pokémon-like text-based game where the player acts as the hero and fights against enemies.
The game uses object-oriented concepts as the basis to include knights, mages and a dragon among 
the enemies. Fine-details added to the storyline to make the program interesting, including hidden 
buffs and power-ups.

Please refer to the 'Description' (PDF) among the files for further information on the game mechanics, design, class diagrams, user interface, testing, etc. Note that some of the implementions have deviated from the description due to additional functionality or changes in the code.

No code was copied from any other internet sources for this project.
This is an independent project undertaken by me and my partner at The University of Adelaide, built from scratch!
