**Note: Game Description**

A 1990’s Pokémon-like text-based game where the player acts as the hero and fights against enemies.
The game uses object-oriented concepts as the basis to include knights, mages and a dragon among 
the enemies. Fine-details added to the storyline to make the program interesting, including hidden 
buffs and power-ups.

Please refer to the 'Description' (PDF) among the files for further information on the game mechanics, design, class diagrams, user interface, testing, etc.

No code was copied from any other internet sources for this project.
This is an independent project undertaken by me and my partner at The University of Adelaide, built from scratch!
